```

## *Problem 1*

#### *A:*

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

num_male = sum(data$Sex == "Male")
num_female = sum(data$Sex == "Female")

males_left = sum(data$Sex == "Male" & data$LonR_fold == 1)
females_left = sum(data$Sex == "Female" & data$LonR_fold == 1)

prop_male = males_left/num_male
prop_female = females_left/num_female

```

In this dataset, there are `r num_male` males and `r num_female` females.\
The # of males who folded their arms left over right is `r males_left`, and the # of females who did that is `r females_left`.\
The sample proportion of males who folded their arms left over right is about `r round(prop_male, digits = 2)`, and the proportion of females who did that is about `r round(prop_female, digits = 2)`.

#### *B:*

The observed difference in proportions between males and females is about `r round(prop_male - prop_female, digits = 2)`.

#### *C:*

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

lefts = c(males_left, females_left)
nums = c(num_male, num_female)

res = prop.test(lefts, nums)
res_confint <- res$conf.int

se = sqrt((prop_male * (1 - prop_male) / num_male) + (prop_female * (1 - prop_female) / num_female))
moe = se*1.96

bound_lower = (prop_male - prop_female - moe)
bound_upper = (prop_male - prop_female + moe)

```

The 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions between males and females is (`r round(res_confint[1], 2)`, `r round(res_confint[2], 2)`). The hand-calculated method involved finding the standard error using the appropriate formula. After substituting the values, the standard error is approximately `r round(se, 4)`, and the margin of error is about `r round(moe, 4)`. The confidence interval bounds were computed by subtracting and adding the margin of error to the observed difference in proportions (`r round(prop_male - prop_female, 2)`). The resulting hand-calculated confidence interval is (`r round(bound_lower, 2)`, `r round(bound_upper, 2)`).

#### *D:*

If I drew multiple samples and conducted many confidence intervals, approximately 95% of those intervals would be expected to capture the true population parameter.

#### *E:*

The Standard Error indicates the expected variation in the difference between male and female sample proportions for folding the left arm on top, assuming we repeatedly draw new samples of the same size from the same population. It reflects the standard deviation of the sample proportion’s deviation from the true population proportion.

#### *F:*

The sampling distribution reflects the variation in the difference between male and female sample proportions across repeated studies. Although individuals, sample proportions, and their differences may change, the population parameters and sample sizes stay the same.

#### G

The CLT supports using a normal distribution to model the difference in sample proportions. When sample sizes are sufficiently large, the sampling distribution becomes approximately normal, regardless of the population’s actual distribution.

#### H

We cannot reject the claim that there is no sex difference in arm folding because the confidence interval (-0.01, 0.30) contains 0, indicating that the true difference might be zero.

#### I

Confidence intervals differ because of variations in sampling. If we repeatedly took samples, 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true difference in arm-folding proportions.

## Problem 2

```{r, include=FALSE}
data2 = tibble(read.csv("turnout.csv"))
```

#### *A:*

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

num_call = sum(data2$GOTV_call == 1)
num_nocall = sum(data2$GOTV_call == 0)

voted1998_call = sum(data2$voted1998 == 1 & data2$GOTV_call == 1)
voted1998_nocall = sum(data2$voted1998 == 1 & data2$GOTV_call == 0)

prop_voted1998_call = voted1998_call/num_call
prop_voted1998_nocall = voted1998_nocall/num_nocall

votes = c(voted1998_call, voted1998_nocall)
total = c(num_call, num_nocall)
          
diff <- prop.test(votes, total)  

```

The proportion of individuals who voted in 1998 and received a GOTV call is approximately `r round(prop_voted1998_call, 2)`, while the proportion who voted without receiving a GOTV call is about `r round(prop_voted1998_nocall, 2)`. The large sample 95% confidence interval for the difference between these two proportions is (`r round(diff$conf.int[1], 2)`, `r round(diff$conf.int[2], 2)`).

#### *B:*

##### *i:*
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

gotv_v96_table <- table(data2$GOTV_call, data2$voted1996)
gotv_v96_test <- prop.test(gotv_v96_table)

print("95% Confidence Interval for the relationship between GOTV calls and voting in 1996:")
gotv_v96_test

v96_v98_table <- table(data2$voted1996, data2$voted1998)
v96_v98_test <- prop.test(v96_v98_table)

print("95% Confidence Interval for the relationship between voting in 1996 and voting in 1998:")
v96_v98_test
```

The voted1996 variable acts as a confounder in assessing the causal effect of GOTV calls on voting in 1998, since it raises the chances of both receiving a call and voting in 1998. This is supported by the 95% confidence intervals from the prop.test, which exclude zero, indicating that voting in 1996 affects both outcomes. As a result, it must be considered when evaluating the causal link between GOTV calls and 1998 voting behavior.

##### *ii:*

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gotv_majorparty_table <- table(data2$GOTV_call, data2$MAJORPTY)
gotv_majorparty_test <- prop.test(gotv_majorparty_table)

print("95% Confidence Interval for the relationship between GOTV calls and major party registration:")
gotv_majorparty_test

v98_majorparty_table <- table(data2$voted1998, data2$MAJORPTY)
v98_majorparty_test <- prop.test(v98_majorparty_table)

print("95% Confidence Interval for the relationship between voting in 1998 and major party registration:")
v98_majorparty_test
```

The MAJORPTY variable is a confounder in determining the causal effect of GOTV calls on voting in 1998, as it increases the likelihood of both receiving a call and voting. This is supported by the 95% confidence intervals from the prop.test, which do not contain zero, indicating that major party registration affects both outcomes. Therefore, it should be accounted for when analyzing the causal relationship between GOTV calls and voting behavior in 1998.

##### *iii:*
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

boxplot(data2$AGE ~ data2$GOTV_call,
        names = c("No Call", "Received Call"),
        main = "Distribution of Age by GOTV Call",
        xlab = "GOTV Call Status",
        ylab = "Participant Age",
        col = c("beige", "green"))

print("95% Confidence Interval for mean age by GOTV call status")
age_gotv_call_test <- t.test(data2$AGE ~ data2$GOTV_call)
age_gotv_call_test

boxplot(data2$AGE ~ data2$voted1998,
        names = c("Did Not Vote", "Voted"),
        main = "Distribution of Age by 1998 Voting Status",
        xlab = "1998 Voting Status",
        ylab = "Participant Age",
        col = c("coral", "seagreen"))


print("95% Confidence Interval for mean age by voting status in 1998")
age_voting_1998_test <- t.test(data2$AGE ~ data2$voted1998)
age_voting_1998_test


```

The AGE variable is a confounder in assessing the causal effect of GOTV calls on voting in 1998, as it increases the likelihood of both receiving a call and voting. This is demonstrated by the boxplots showing higher median ages and the t.test 95% confidence intervals for mean age, which exclude zero. Since age influences both variables, it must be considered when examining the causal relationship between GOTV calls and voting in 1998.

#### *C:*

##### *i:*
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}


matched_data <- matchit(GOTV_call ~ AGE + MAJORPTY + voted1996, data = data2, ratio = 5) %>% match.data()

print("Matched confidence intervals for GOTV calls and voting in 1996")
matched_v96_table <- table(matched_data$GOTV_call, matched_data$voted1996)
prop.test(matched_v96_table)

print("Matched confidence intervals for GOTV calls and major party registration")
matched_majorparty_table <- table(matched_data$GOTV_call, matched_data$MAJORPTY)
prop.test(matched_majorparty_table)

print("Matched confidence intervals for GOTV calls and mean ages")
t.test(matched_data$AGE ~ matched_data$GOTV_call)


```

The 95% confidence intervals for the confounding variables—voting in 1996, major party registration, and age all include zero, suggesting that the dataset is balanced between those who received a call and those who did not, given the 5:1 ratio of control to treated cases.

##### *ii:*
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}


call_count_balanced <- sum(matched_data$GOTV_call == 1)
nocall_count_balanced <- sum(matched_data$GOTV_call == 0)

voted_1998_call_balanced <- sum(matched_data$voted1998 == 1 & matched_data$GOTV_call == 1)
voted_1998_nocall_balanced <- sum(matched_data$voted1998 == 1 & matched_data$GOTV_call == 0)

prop_1998_call_balanced <- voted_1998_call_balanced / call_count_balanced
prop_1998_nocall_balanced <- voted_1998_nocall_balanced / nocall_count_balanced

votes_balanced <- c(voted_1998_call_balanced, voted_1998_nocall_balanced)
totals_balanced <- c(call_count_balanced, nocall_count_balanced)

diff_balanced <- prop.test(votes_balanced, totals_balanced)



```

The proportion of individuals who received a GOTV call and voted in 1998 using the matched data is `r round(prop_1998_call_balanced, 3)`, while the proportion who did not receive a call and voted is `r round(prop_1998_nocall_balanced, 3)`. The large sample 95% confidence interval for the difference between these proportions is (`r round(diff_balanced$conf.int[1], 3)`, `r round(diff_balanced$conf.int[2], 3)`). Because this interval does not contain zero, it suggests that receiving a GOTV call significantly increases the likelihood of voting in the 1998 election.
